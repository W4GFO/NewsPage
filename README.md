This is from the Frontend mentor project:
[News Homepage](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl/hub)

## Getting Started 

This project was crated with the following command:

```
> npx create-react-app news-room --template typescript
```

The additional npm installs needed are:

```
> npm install sass
> npm install react-icons
> npm install react-router-dom
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Primary Work

In this project I was concentrating on the Grid and Flexbox layouts and having them work together.

Also, I wanted to concentrate on the animation of the menu bar's sliding into and out of view on the mobile form-factor.

### Questions & Issues

I had some issues lining up the main image on the page - especially on the desktop.

I would appreciate any feedback on this issue that anyone see.

The code for the homepage image styling is in 'HomePageStyle.scss' on line 68. This is where I was playing around with the layout for the large image the most.

Also, I ran into chanllenges animating the hamburger menu to the provided 'X' icon. I have this set up in the JSX and wasn't sure how to animate this. I understand supplying images in HTML instead of CSS is more efficient, but then I run into this problem.  If anyone has any suggestions I would certainly welcome your feedback.

The code for the hamburger and X icons are in 'NavbarFrame.tsx' on line 16 and 24.

Thank you in advance for any input.
